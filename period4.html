    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is a very complex class that is sometimes hard to understand, and is taught by my math teacher Mrs. Canizales. This class is all about lessons and tests which is very annoying and repetitive at time, but is very easy. This class is sometimes very hard because of the tests that Mrs. Canizales makes worth 65% of our overall grade, but if you study hard you can get an easy A. Unfortunately, we don't usually have fun or take off days in this class, but the work that we do is easy to understand and learn. Overall, Mrs. Canizales class is easy but is not that interesting or fun to be in, because we mostly do work.  </p>
