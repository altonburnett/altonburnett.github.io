    <p class="paragraphTitle">Spanish</p>
    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is taught by my spanish teacher Mr. Chava which is a very nice, skillful, and qualified teacher to teach Spanish 1. He teaches us many concepts and gives us activities in our textbooks so we understand the meanings. Mr. Chava also lets us eat and talk to each other about the lesson so we can gain social skills, and have a better understanding of the spanish concepts. Mr. Chava also shows us visual presentations of our lessons so that we can also understand the culture behind the words and concepts we are learning. Overall, Mr. Chava's class is very fun and difficult at the same time, which gives the class a perfect balance.  </p>
