    <p class="paragraphTitle">Spanish</p>
    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is taught by my spanish teacher Mr. Chava which is a very nice, skillful, and qualified teacher to teach Spanish 1. He teaches us many concepts and gives us activities in our textbooks so we understand the meanings. Mr. Chava also lets us eat and talk to each other about the lesson so we can gain social skills, and have a better understanding of the spanish concepts. Mr. Chava also shows us visual presentations of our lessons so that we can also understand the culture behind the words and concepts we are learning. Overall, Mr. Chava's class is very fun and difficult at the same time, which gives the class a perfect balance.  </p>
    <p class="paragraphTitle">Course Description</p>
   Spanish 1A (first-year Spanish, first semester) is a communicative beginning-level Spanish course.
   Students will begin to develop their Spanish proficiency through extensive interaction in the target
   language.
                        <br/><br/>
                Through videos, students see and hear native speakers in authentic locations around the Spanish speaking
                world. There are also numerous audio clips that reinforce the language taught through the
                video segments. Each unit also includes a variety of interactive activities, cultural notes, and cultural
                interviews.The activities help build competency in each of the four language skillsâ€”listening, speaking,
                reading, and writing. The quizzes, midterm, and final in this course are based on the powerpoints,
                videos and activities. 

                <br/><br/>
               Another key component of Spanish 1 A is assessment through project based learning. Every student will
               complete two projects during this course. These projects will allow students to demonstrate their
               mastery of the Spanish language concepts taught in this course, as well as the cultural concepts, in a
               modality that is appropriate for their unique learning style. This course will also include a one hour
               "synchronous chat" every week which will allow students to verbally interact with both the instructor
               and the other students in the class as if they were in a room together!
                <br/><br/>
                Students will encounter authors' perspectives as they read literature from across time periods and cultures. Students will listen to the perspectives of their peers through conversations and collaborative activities. As students read the literature and engage in activities, they will formulate--and defend--their opinions as they develop their own perspectives.
                <br/><br/>
                Course objectives: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin to develop their ability to communicate effectively and express themselves with
                        confidence in Spanish.</li>
                    <li>Practice pronunciation skills by recording and listening to their own voice and comparing it to
                        the voices of native speakers.</li>
                    <li>Have the opportunity to enhance their awareness of, and appreciation for, the diversity of the
                        Spanish-speaking world.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBody">
                This is an inquiry-based course where you will discover and utilize knowledge of Spanish language via
                the lectures, videos, and other readings, and class discussions with other students and the instructor.
                <br/><br/>
                Acting as a facilitator, your instructor will guide you through the process; however, as the learner, you
                are responsible for actively acquiring and constructing knowledge by completing all assigned readings
                and activities.

                <br/><br/>
                Both courses offer rigorous instruction in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Wide-ranging vocabulary development</li>
                <li>Close reading for rhetorical analysis</li>
                <li>Logical organization of student generated writing</li>
                <li>Literacy and rhetorical analysis; traditional writing; synthesis of vocab, information etc.</li>
                <li>Close reading of texts across a wide range of time periods, with multiple choice testing.</li>
                <p class="paragraphBody">
                Spanish is a requirement in every high school for two years so that one's a given. To get into UC/California State University colleges, 2 years of college-preparatory spanish that include frequent and regular writing and reading of literature. No more than one year of spanish-type courses can be used to meet this requirement.
