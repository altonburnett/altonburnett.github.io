    <p class="paragraphTitle">PE</p>
    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is a very repetitive and difficult class that is taught by my PE teacher Mr. Ramirez. He gives us many different running assignments which is sometimes very tiring, but we get to rest and play sports after this activities. We sometimes get easy off days when we do what we are told and give the best effort that we can possibly give, but we don't usually earn these off days to often. This class is often one of the worst classes for some students, but for other studnets it is easy to go through like me. Overall, Mr. Ramirez's class is a very reptitive, fun, and diffifult class to go through and coome out with a good grade in.</p>
