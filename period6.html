    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is the easiest class a have in terms of lessons, and is taught by my science teacher Mr. Gaede. This class consists of a lot of note taking, projects, and experiments, but it is easy because we have everything we need given to us. We often work in big groups in this class which makes everything much easier, because you can get other people's opinion. The homework in this class is often given all on the same day for the lesson that we go over which is easier for everyone to complete. Overall, Mr. Gaede's class is a fun, out-going, and easy class to get your work done and have a grade that you are completely satisfied with.  </p>
