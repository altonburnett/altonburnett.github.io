    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is my first period class, and this class is taught by my english teacher Mrs. Strode. Mrs. Strode's class is not very easy because she gives us many essays, and she has a grading scale that is very hard. I am also in honors which makes the class much harder and difficult, but I like to be challenged. A lot of the students in Mrs. Strode's class don't like all the essays and the endless projects that we have to go through. Overall, Mrs. Strode's class is and average class that is most likely not every person's favorite class.</p>
