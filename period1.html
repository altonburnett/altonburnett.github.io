                In the English curriculum, most schools still have the same levels of basic courses, advanced courses, and honors courses. 
                The basic level for a 9th grader is often listed as English I (may also be called English 9). This course will often teach 
                the fundamentals of higher-level literature and how to analyze and respond to such literature. The advanced course is often
                English II (may also be called English 10) and is usually a genre studies type of English class, but it may instead be focused
                on one type of literature, such as American literature or British Literature. The honors level for 9th grade is usually English
                III (may also be called English 11) and is usually focused on one type of literature (i.e. American Literature, British Literature),
                but if this was already covered it previous classes, it may be a genre study English course. Although rare, a district or school may
                allow a student to take AP Literature their 9th grade year.

                Students will encounter authors' perspectives as they read literature from across time periods and cultures. Students will listen to the perspectives of their peers through conversations and collaborative activities. As students read the literature and engage in activities, they will formulate--and defend--their opinions as they develop their own perspectives.
                <br/><br/>
                Course objectives: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>apply critical reading strategies to increase understanding of texts</li>
                    <li>write for a variety of purposes</li>
                    <li>confidently lead and/or participate in discussions</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBody">
                The focus of English Language and Composition is on the development and revision of evidence-based analytic and argumentative writing and the rhetorical analysis of nonfiction texts.
                <br/><br/>
                Both courses offer rigorous instruction in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Wide-ranging vocabulary development</li>
                <li>Close reading for rhetorical analysis</li>
                <li>Logical organization of student generated writing, with intense editing, revision and mastery</li>
                <li>Literacy and rhetorical analysis; argumentative writing; synthesis of research, information etc.</li>
                <li>Close reading of nonfiction and fiction texts across a wide range of time periods, with multiple choice testing.</li>
