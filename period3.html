    <p class="paragraphTitle">Computer Science</p>
    <p class="paragraphBody">This class is a really fun and interesting class, and it is taught by my computer science teacher Mr. Thoe. In this class we learn different computer skills like how to make games and websites, but by using code like python, turtle, and html. This class is interesting because I have never know how to many games or websties but always wondering how creators made such nice and complex games, which I now know how. However, this class is a very challenging because it is an AP class, and I came in to this class knowing nothing but now I have learned more than I would ever had found out by myself. Overall, Mr. Thoe's class is a very fun, detailed, interesting, and complex way to learn new computer skills that I never had before, and it could translate in many job opportunities. </p>
